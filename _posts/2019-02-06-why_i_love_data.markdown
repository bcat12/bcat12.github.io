     When I was a little boy, my dad had a collection of what looked like trophies that he kept in our basement. I learned later that they commemorated the many deals he had worked on as an investment banker for financial institutions. Those trophies moved with us several times after my father died when I was seven. In truth, those trophies, a reminder of the deals my dad had done, spent more time at home than my dad ever did. His work consumed him. When I went off to college, I assumed I would be just like my dad, and I thought I would major in business. But while I loved working with numbers the way my dad did, typical business courses didnâ€™t interest me. As an statistics-based economics major, I was fascinated by how data could be used to help companies or institutions make conclusions about facets of their operations that would otherwise remain mysterious.	 
		 
      In searching for a career, I stalled, in part because in the first job I got after college, the company I worked at was too short-handed and busy to have a department devoted to what I enjoyed doing most.  However, at this company I realized how my interests and skills coincided in the field of Data Science. Using a comprehensive spreadsheet to track thousands of backlogged orders, I automated what had been a haphazard system.  Ultimately, I created a chart with a brand new labeling and delivery system that pacified 120 angry store managers.	 
			
     Solving issues with data analysis and statistics is ultimately what lead me to pursue a career in data science. I rediscovered my love for math, statistics, and problem solving through data analysis. I look forward to furthering my skill set to maximize my potential as a data scientist.
